    <h1>Surfing Tips: Spring Tides vs. Neap Tides</h1>
    
    <h2>Spring Tides</h2>
    <p><strong>What Are They?</strong> Spring tides occur during the <em>new moon</em> and <em>full moon</em> phases, causing the highest high tides and lowest low tides.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact on Surfing:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Stronger, more powerful waves, ideal for experienced surfers.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Low tides can expose hazards like rocks and reefs. Certain spots may be too shallow.</p>

    <h2>Neap Tides</h2>
    <p><strong>What Are They?</strong> Neap tides occur during the <em>first quarter</em> and <em>last quarter</em> moon phases, resulting in more moderate high and low tides.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact on Surfing:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Stable conditions, smaller and more predictable waves, ideal for beginners.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Waves may lack power, especially at spots that rely on strong tidal flow.</p>

    <h2>Which Is Better?</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Spring Tides:</strong> Great for experienced surfers seeking bigger, more powerful waves.</p>
    <p><strong>Neap Tides:</strong> Perfect for beginners or those who prefer gentler, more predictable surf conditions.</p>

    <h2>Additional Considerations:</h3>

    <p><strong>Local Knowledge:</strong> Certain surf spots perform better at specific tides.</p>
    <p><strong>Timing:</strong> The best surf conditions often occur during incoming or outgoing tides, depending on the spot.</p>
